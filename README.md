# blackjack-game
My first project made while working through the Scrimba The Frontend Developer Career Path. This is a basic JS BlackJack game. I plan on implementing some stretch goals in the future.

Hello, Blackjack game is a fairly straightforward interpretation of the popular card game, made using JS/HTML/CSS. When the game loads the user can start the game & continue drawing cards until 
they hit 21. The functionality is nowhere near as robust as the game in real life. As of right now there is not a win state, a way for the user to enter there name, or an option
to reset the game. I do plan on adding these features and many more in the future.
